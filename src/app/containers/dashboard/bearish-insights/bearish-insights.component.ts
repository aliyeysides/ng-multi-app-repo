          Lag</h5>
        <h6>Key Points</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>&bull;&nbsp; Stocks hold steady as Fed confirms balance sheet unwind</li>
          <li>&bull;&nbsp; Dollar jumps the most this year as Fed sees another 2017 hike</li>
          <li>&bull;&nbsp; Yields advance +3 bps to new one-month highs</li>
          <li>&bull;&nbsp; Oil closes above $50 after inventories fail to trigger selling</li>
          <li>&bull;&nbsp; SPX, DJIA & IWC hit records. DJTA & IWM less than 1% away</li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Groups: Drugs (Rank: Strong) / Amgen â€“ AMGN (PGR: Very Bullish)</h6>
        <p>AMGN triggered a Momentum Breakout alert yesterday. The stock traded to new record highs recently after
          breaking out of a 6-month ascending triangle. AMGN became overbought above the upper band, which has stalled
          the advance.</p>
        <p>The ensuing backing & filling, however, has been constructive, with price building a potential Bull-Flag
          formation. Money-Flow, Relative Strength and the PGR have all remained positive during the pullback. Look to
          buy AMGN when the OBOS oscillator reaches oversold territory and then turns up, provided, of course, that the
          Chaikin Credentials hold positive. The 1-2 month price objective is 195-200.</p>
